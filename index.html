                <p class="biography">Kahlo was born Magdalena Carmen Frieda Kahlo y Calderón on July 6, 1907, in Coyoacán, Mexico City, Mexico.

                Kahlo's father, Wilhelm (also called Guillermo), was a German photographer who had immigrated to Mexico where he met and married her mother Matilde. She had two older sisters, Matilde and Adriana, and her younger sister, Cristina, was born the year after Kahlo.
                
                    Around the age of six, Kahlo contracted polio, which caused her to be bedridden for nine months. While she recovered from the illness, she limped when she walked because the disease had damaged her right leg and foot. Her father encouraged her to play soccer, go swimming, and even wrestle — highly unusual moves for a girl at the time — to help aid in her recovery.</p>

                <p class="artist-biography">She did not originally plan to become an artist; rather, Kahlo, who was a polio survivor, entered a prestigious pre-medical program when she was 15. Three years later, Kahlo was gravely hurt in a bus accident. She spent more than a year in bed, recovering from multiple fractures of her back, collarbone, and ribs, as well as a shattered pelvis and shoulder and foot injuries. Kahlo spent the rest of her life in constant pain, finally succumbing to related complications at the age of 47.

                    During her recovery, Kahlo started painting in oils, creating deliberately naive self-portraits and still lifes filled with the bright colors and flattened forms of the Mexican folk art she had always loved. In 1929, Kahlo married the much older Mexican muralist Diego Rivera, whose approach to art and political activism complemented her own. Theirs was a volatile relationship that underwent marital infidelities, the pressures of Rivera’s career, a divorce and remarriage, and Kahlo’s deteriorating health.
                    
                    Kahlo and Rivera traveled to the United States and France, where she encountered many influential figures from the worlds of art and politics. In 1938, she had her first solo exhibition at the Julien Levy Gallery in New York. She enjoyed international success beginning in the 1940s. Her reputation soared posthumously, beginning in the 1980s with the publication of numerous books about her work by feminist art historians and others.</p>
